Here you can find some excersices for different languages that I have solved trying to improve my coding skills.

You can use them as a guide for your own problems.

Some problems have been found on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), others on the wild through the internet.

I'm open to receive feedback or PR to add new exercies or fix issues with the current code.

Have fun and keep learning 🖖🏼.
